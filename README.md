bfx-opam-repo
=============

Opam repository to install bioinformatics tools (the non-OCaml ones).

Usage
-----

If you got Opam with an OCaml compiler, these packages will work happily in the
middle of any Opam switch.

If you got the binary version of Opam, without an OCaml compiler, and you don't
want to compile OCaml, you can use the `fake.0.0.1` “compiler”.
